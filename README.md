- **PHP**: server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages
- **HTML**: markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages
- **CSS**: styling language used to define the layout and appearance of web pages
- **JavaScript**: programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages
- **phpMyAdmin**: web-based application used to manage MySQL and MariaDB databases
